# react-weather-component
Display weather for current location.

## IMPORTANT!
GitHub serves all GitHub Pages content via `https`, however, the OpenWeatherMap API does not currently function on `https`. Therefore, the demo pages aren't working correctly. I'm working to resolve this (possibly with another API provider).

To test outside of GitHub Pages, clone the repo, run `npm install && npm start` and visit http://localhost:8080.

## Install
```shell
npm install react-weather-component --save
```
